## The Basics

Sunday, September 2nd, 2018. The ceremony will be in the evening, tentatively beginning around 5pm. Dinner and dancing will follow.

### Where's it happening?
The ceremony and reception will both be taking place at [Roger Williams Botanical Center](https://rwpconservancy.org/explore/botanical-center/),  a beautiful botanical garden in the South Elmwood neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island. The festivities will be indoors, in a greenhouse which is fully accessible.

## FAQ

### How do I RSVP?
Simple! Just fill out this [Google form](https://goo.gl/forms/2lT99z1wkBAaldvD3), which is also linked to in the site navigation. If you have trouble with the form or need additional help, don't hesitate to email either the bride or groom for assistance:

[wfairbrother@gmail.com](mailto:wfairbrother@gmail.com?cc=daniel.letson@gmail.com)<br>
[daniel.letson@gmail.com](mailto:daniel.letson@gmail.com?cc=wfairbrother@gmail.com)

### I'm not quite sure I can make it. When's the latest I can let you know?
We ask that all invited guests RSVP by the 1st of August so we can get an accurate headcount for catering, and make appropriate accommodations.

### What should I wear?
Cocktail attire is requested. The greenhouses are temperature-controlled, so feel free to dress for summer. There are lots of cobblestones and sandy paths on the grounds and in the greenhouses that pointy heels might get stuck in, so choose shoes appropriately.
Most wedding decor will be shades of white, but since it's being held in a botanical garden, there will be lots of green! Wonja will be in white/cream, and Dan will be in a light grey suit in case you're curious.  

### Where should I stay?
There are many great hotel options in downtown Providence, including chic, boutique spots like [The Dean](https://thedeanhotel.com) and [Providence Hotel](https://www.hotelprovidence.com), and charming New England bed-and-breakfasts like [The Old Court](http://www.oldcourt.com) or [The Christopher Dodge House](https://www.providence-hotel.com). The bride and groom will be staying in an AirBnB in the Elmwood neighborhood in Southwestern Providence.

### Is there a registry?
Daniel and Wonja are forgoing a registry, but in-person cash or check donations will be happily accepted with our gratitude.
