## The Basics

### When's the big day?
It all happens Sunday, September 2nd, 2018. The ceremony will be in the evening, tentatively beginning around 5pm. Dinner and dancing will follow.

### Where's it all happening?
The ceremony and reception will both be taking place at Roger Williams Botanical Center, a beautiful botanical garden in the South Elmwood region of Providence, Rhode Island. The festivities will be indoors, in a greenhouse which is fully accessible.

The Botanical Center is inside Roger Williams Park, a public park which hosts many family-friendly attractions such as picnic areas, paddle boat rentals, a planetarium, and even a zoo!

The mailing address is:
Roger Williams Park, 1000 Elmwood Ave, Providence, RI 02907<br>

Daniel and Wonja are forgoing a registry, but in-person cash or check donations will be happily accepted with our gratitude.
